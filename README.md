# airfoil

This software is aimed to classify airfoil types into different categories of aerodynamic features using a neural network trained with NACA airfoil data. Airfoil parameters such as the camber and thickness is compared and the variation of lift and drag with angle of attack is also acknowledged. The unitless parameters of lift and drag coefficents are the primary variables to be compared, as they can be related even with different sized airfoils and aircrafts. The goal of this software is to be able to accurately predict the performance of an airfoil given its parameters.
