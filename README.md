# Airfoil Neural Network Project

## Project Goal

Build a neural network to classify airfoils based on their geometrical parameters and predict their aerodynamic coefficients (lift and drag).

- **Input:** Numerical values representing airfoil geometry (e.g., thickness, camber, chord length).
- **Output:** Predicted lift and drag coefficients for an airfoil (e.g., NACA 2412).

## Project Structure

- `data/` – Store your datasets here.
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments.
- `src/` – Source code for data processing, modeling, and utilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your data to the `data/` folder.
4. Start experimenting in the `notebooks/` directory or build scripts in `src/`.

## Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for package requirements.
